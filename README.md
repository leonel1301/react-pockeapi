# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and includes some ESLint rules.

Currently, there are two official plugins available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): This plugin uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Running a React Application with Vite

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine or downloading it as a ZIP file and extracting it to a directory of your choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leonel1301/react-pockeapi.git
```
### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the cloned application directory and install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```
### 3. Run the application
To run the application in development mode with HMR, execute the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server, and you can access your application in your web browser at the provided address (typically, http://localhost:5173). Changes to your code will automatically update in real-time thanks to HMR.
